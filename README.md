Blood Bank Management System
Overview
This project is a web-based Blood Bank Management System built with PHP and MySQL. It helps users, hospitals, and administrators manage blood donations, requests, inventories, and notifications efficiently.

What is this project about?
This Blood Bank Management System is designed to streamline the process of blood donation and management. It serves as a platform where donors can register, schedule donations, and track their donation history. Hospitals can request blood units when needed, and administrators can oversee the entire system, including approving blood requests and managing inventory across different states.

The system aims to bridge the gap between blood donors and healthcare facilities, ensuring that blood is available when and where it's needed most. It includes features like real-time notifications, reward points for donors, and comprehensive inventory tracking to make the blood donation process more efficient and accessible.
